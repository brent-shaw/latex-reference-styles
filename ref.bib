  abstract = {The increasing interconnectivity of \{SCADA\} (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks has exposed them to a wide range of network security problems. This paper provides an overview of all the crucial research issues that are involved in strengthening the cyber security of \{SCADA\} networks. The paper describes the general architecture of \{SCADA\} networks and the properties of some of the commonly used \{SCADA\} communication protocols. The general security threats and vulnerabilities in these networks are discussed followed by a survey of the research challenges facing \{SCADA\} networks. The paper discusses the ongoing work in several \{SCADA\} security areas such as improving access control, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, \{SCADA\} protocol analyses, cryptography and key management, device and operating system security. Many trade and research organizations are involved in trying to standardize \{SCADA\} security technologies. The paper concludes with an overview of these standardization efforts. },

Whilst contemporary research has identified the need for protecting \{SCADA\} systems, these information are disparate and do not provide a coherent view of the threats and the risks resulting from the tendency to integrate these once isolated systems into corporate networks that are prone to cyber attacks. This paper surveys ongoing research and provides a coherent overview of the threats, risks and mitigation strategies in the area of \{SCADA\} security. },

  abstract = {Abstract Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as \{RFID\} tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. },

Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details. },
