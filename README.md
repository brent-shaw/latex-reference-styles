# latex-reference-styles

The goal of this document is collect and build up a set of templates for styling Latex documents.

The plan was to include the prefered styles for well known confernce and manuscript formats such as IEEE.

I also thought it would be nice to have a document that shows how to perform various Latex tasks, such as 2 column text with double wide figures, or subfigures, etc. The idea was to have a document for each format that would act like a "good example" of how these things should be done.
